## What is Tamper Protection?

It is a Windows 10 feature that protects the Windows security apps like [in-built antivirus – Windows Defender](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/). In reality, it prevents any type of unauthorized external amendments that you do not make through the settings window.
