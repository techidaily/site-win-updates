## Can Phone Get Infected With Viruses?

One of the first questions people have when they find out that their phone may be infected is, “can my phone get a virus?” The short answer to this question is **yes**.

In fact, most experts believe that smartphones are even more vulnerable to malware than computers. A major reason for this is that many people don’t take the same precautions when using their phones that they do when using a computer. 

For example, many people will download apps from sources other than the official Google Play Store and Apple App Store, which can increase the risk of getting infected with malware.

## How do Phones Get Viruses?

There are a number of ways that your phone can become infected with a virus. Here are the most common ones:

* **Unsecured apps**: Many people download various apps on their phones without thinking about the security implications. These [apps may contain malware](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) that can infect your phone, giving hackers access to your personal information and data.
* **Phishing links or emails**. You may receive a link in an email or text message that seems to be from a trusted source. However, if you follow the link, it may actually take you to a website that installs malware on your phone.
* **Downloading files from unknown sources**: If you’re someone who likes to download files from torrents or other websites, then there’s a good chance that your device has been infected with a virus at some point.
* **Malicious Websites**: Hackers can also install malware on your phone by creating a fake website that looks like a legitimate site.

## How Viruses Affects your Phone?

Viruses are a common threat to any device that is connected to the internet. They can spread quickly and cause serious damage to your phone if you aren’t careful. There are many things a virus or malware can do to your phone.

### Degrading the Performance

One of the most common ways that viruses affect your phone is by slowing down its performance. This happens because the virus uses up memory and resources, causing your phone to run more slowly.

If you notice that the apps on your phone are taking longer to open than they used to, or if your battery drains faster than normal, it may be a sign that you have a virus on your phone.

### Damaging Important Files

Another way that viruses can affect your phone is by damaging important files on your device. This can include everything from photos and documents to apps and software, so it’s essential that you take steps to protect yourself.

One of the best ways to prevent this kind of damage is by using antivirus software on your phone. This will scan your device regularly and remove any viruses that are detected, helping to keep your files safe.

### Spying on Your Activities

In addition to causing damage to your physical device, a virus can also put your privacy at risk. Viruses often have the [ability to collect information about your phone](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) use and then send it back to their creators.

For example, they can harvest details like the sites you visit, videos or apps that you download, and even your location. This allows them to create a profile of your activities and sell this data without your knowledge.

### Reducing the Battery Life

A virus can also affect your battery life by draining the power more quickly than usual. This happens because viruses use up resources and consume additional energy, which can have a significant impact on your phone’s performance.

### Overheating your Device

Most viruses also have the ability to make your phone hotter than usual. This is because they can generate a lot of additional processing power, causing your device to overheat and potentially damage itself.

### Unusual Data Consumption

Another common issue that people experience when they have a virus on their phones is unusual data consumption. If you’re worried about your phone using more data than it should, this could be a sign that you have a virus on your device.

### Blocking Updates

Finally, some viruses also have the ability to block updates that your phone needs in order to stay safe. This can include updates to apps or anti-virus software, which means that you may be more vulnerable to attacks if you don’t take steps to protect yourself.

## Tips to Safeguard Devices from Viruses

Protecting your device from malware is better than curing it after the infection. We have listed out the top tips that would help you to over keep a distance from malware. The tips would protect you from other malware programs too.

* Keep installed a robust security solution on your Android phone.
* Ensure that all your apps and the OS are updated with the latest version. An outdated app and OS carries loose ends and is vulnerable to malware attacks.
* Never click on any suspicious links from unknown emails and text messages.
* Avoid app downloads and installations from unknown sources. Only use the Google Play Store or other trusted sources. If you require an app outside of trusted sources, then scan it thoroughly before installation, and verify that it is secure.
* Avoid torrents and free download sites.
* Never use unprotected, opened public WiFi. If it is urgent, use a VPN along with that.
