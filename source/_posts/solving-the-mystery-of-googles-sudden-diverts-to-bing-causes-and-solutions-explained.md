Using Bing.com does not bring any harm to your device. However, many users get unintentional redirects to Bing.com, while they are searching on Google.com. This redirection is carried out through the malware known as [Browser Hijacker](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/).

In this guide, we would talk more about what Browser Hijacker is and how to remove it from your system to fix Google redirects to Bing.

## What is a Browser Hijacker?

A **Browser Hijacker,** commonly known as the Browser Virus,is a malicious program that gets an entry on your web browser through various means and infiltrates with browser settings, without user permission to promote the fake search engines or the affiliated web pages. Since users do not willingly install them, such hijackers are often considered as Potentially Unwanted Programs or Applications ([PUPs](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) or PUAs).

After entering your browser, a browser hijacker would get hold of its settings and change the default home page, search engine, and new tab redirection. All these would be set to raise the dubious web page or search engine.

Usually, these forced redirections are performed to generate advertising revenues or promote affiliated products and services.

You might feel that browser hijackers are not much of a threat to your system, and there is no need to get scared of it. Unfortunately, you’re mistaken. Browser Hijackers itself might not be a significant threat, but when it enters your system, it can bring other greater threats such as spyware, keyloggers, and other malware programs with it. These malicious software can cause extensive damage to you and your system. Also, the webpages it promotes cannot be trusted. They might be filled with illegitimate and malicious content. Once you know about it, [removing the browser virus](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) from your system should be your top priority.

## Why does Google search redirect to Bing?

If Google is your default search engine, but every search query you type on it is redirected to Bing, then definitely a browser hijacker has compromised your system.

As mentioned in the previous section, the browser hijacker might have altered your system settings, and that’s the reason the search query is redirected to Bing without your permission.

## How to stop Google redirects to Bing?

To stop Google redirects to Bing, you have to catch and remove the culprit browser hijacker, which is the root cause.

For that follow these steps:

### **Step 1: Restart your PC in Safe Mode**

Windows Safe Mode is the perfect environment to find out and solve the critical errors in the system. In safe mode, only system programs and some crucial programs run. Safe mode would most likely kill the applications and its files that try to run automatically on your system. [Follow this guide to boot your Windows 10 PC in the **Safe Mode**](https://www.windowschimp.com/how-to-boot-windows-10-into-safe-mode/)**.**

### **Step 2: Remove Web Extensions From Browser**

You might have accidentally installed a malicious browser web extension that is causing the redirects.

If you have many web extensions installed in your Chrome browser, it is time to sort them out and at least disable, if not delete, the ones you rarely use. However, you must remove the useless web extensions instead of disabling them. Because, even after disabling them, they might use the CPU processing power while checking for updates and performing updates.

Here are the steps to manage the web extensions on the Chrome Browser:

1. Click on the three dots at the top-right corner.
2. Bring mouse cursor over **More tools** and from the extended menu choose **Extensions**.![Extensions settings](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Extensions-settings.png)
3. All the extensions would be on your screen
4. Look for the ones you want to disable or remove.![manage chrome extensions](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/manage-chrome-extensions.jpg)

### **Step 3: Reset Web Browser Settings**

If your browser is misbehaving because browser virus, then reset its settings to default.

1. Open Chrome and navigate to **Settings** by clicking on the three-dots at the top right.![Chrome Settings](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Chrome-Malware-Scanner-1.png)
2. Click on advanced **Advanced**.![Chrome Advanced Settings](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Chrome-Malware-Scanner-2.png)
3. Under **Reset and cleanup,** click on “**Restore settings to their original defaults.”**![Restore chrome](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Restore-chrome.png)
4. Select **Reset settings** on the next prompt.![reset the chrome](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/reset-the-chrome.png)
5. Relaunch your browser.

### **Step 4: Uninstall Suspicious Applications**

If the Bing redirection is still happening on your PC, try to find the culprit application and uninstall it. 

1. Right-click on the taskbar and select the **Task Manager**.  
![Open Task Manager](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Open-Task-Manger.png)
2. Watch out for the applications that are consuming the system memory even though you did not install or launch them.
3. Right-click on the suspicious application and open its file location.  
![uninstall suspicous files](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/uninstall-suspicous-files.png)
4. Delete the file from its root location.
5. Open Control Panel and click on **Uninstall a program** and check for suspicious apps. One by one, select and uninstall them.![uninstall the apps](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/uninstall-the-apps.png)

### **Step 5: Delete Temporary Files**

The temporary files folder can also be a carrier of malicious files. You should delete all the temporary files and folders regularly for the smooth running of the system. Removing the temporary files would also clear the unnecessary clutter from your system and free-up the valuable space.

Here are the steps to eliminate thre temporary files:

1. Open the Run command window.
2. Type **%temp%** and hit the enter key.![temp run command](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/temp-run-command.png)
3. This run command would navigate you to this path: **_C:\\Users\\\[username\]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp,_** that is, the temp folder.

Thanks so much, turns out one of my extensions was redirecting me to bing… works perfectly now!

I’ve tried everything possible to get the malware off of my chrome. I do not have any extensions and it still brings up Bing when I search something. My chrome crashing constantly and opens randomly. Please help.
