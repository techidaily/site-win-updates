Hello.  
Thanks for the write-up.  
I would like to ask a more direct question. If POP and IMP are “disabled” in my Gmail account, does that block a hacker making a request to retrieve my emails if they happen to know my username and password?

   If someone knows your username and password, nothing can stop them to access your account.  
   You must have 2 Factor authentication enabled to avoid access using only password.
