* [Application Repackaging](https://tools.techidaily.com/advancedinstaller/products/)
* [Repackaging process](https://tools.techidaily.com/advancedinstaller/products/)

### Repackaging Methods: via Snapshot or via PSAppDeployToolkit

WHAT YOU'LL MASTER

The practice of adapting or updating existing installation packages to fit specific criteria is known as application re-packaging. Transforms, which are adjustments to an existing package that are implemented during installation without affecting the original package itself, are one technique for re-packaging.

### Application repackaging as a method for deploying applications

WHAT YOU'LL MASTER

Application repackaging is a strong way to distribute programs in an enterprise environment, with many advantages over alternative methods. Repackaging entails capturing an application's data, registry settings, and other components and structuring them into an MSI package format that can be readily installed on target systems.

### Repackaging process to ensure a smooth and successful outcome

WHAT YOU'LL MASTER

It is critical to adequately prepare before beginning the repackaging process to ensure a smooth and successful outcome. Understanding the software to be packaged, gathering the necessary resources, and laying a solid foundation for the repackaging project are all part of proper preparation. This chapter delves into key considerations and best practices for repackaging preparation.

### Capturing an Application with Repackager

WHAT YOU'LL MASTER

Advanced Installer includes a powerful repackaging solution for converting traditional installations into MSI packages. It offers a user-friendly interface and an array of features, simplifying the creation of professional and reliable MSI packages. What is the SnapShot Method? The snapshot method is a popular technique for creating installer packages in application repackaging. Let's take a closer look at the snapshot method and how it's used in Advanced Repackager.

### Use Properties and MSI self-healing process to customize your app

WHAT YOU'LL MASTER

An advertised shortcut is a pointer to a file or folder that is installed by an MSI package. When running an advertised shortcut, Windows Installer first checks that all the components of the respective feature are installed before running the file. If any of the components are missing, Windows Installer repairs the installation by installing the missing components. This ensures that the application remains consistent and that all of its features are available when required.

### Manipulating of registry classes with Advanced Installer

WHAT YOU'LL MASTER

Advanced Installer supports working with COM components extensively, including the ability to define custom interfaces, type libraries, and classes. The Advanced Installer GUI can be used to define and register these components.One of the primary advantages of using Advanced Installer for COM component work is its ability to generate registry entries and other configuration data automatically based on the information defined in the installation package. This can greatly simplify the process of creating and managing COM components, particularly in complex applications requiring multiple components and interfaces.

### Delete empty directories using Powershell or Custom Actions

WHAT YOU'LL MASTER

Technically, during the uninstallation process, based on what directories are defined in the Directory table, the MSI usually handles the deletion of all directories and assures a clean machine. Looking at the requirements, it might be the case that the application creates another directory that isn’t present in the Directory table, and when the MSI is uninstalled, the directories will remain behind.

### Installing unsigned drivers using custom actions

WHAT YOU'LL MASTER

Create a digital certificate by using the MakeCert tool Open an x86/x64 Free Build Environment command prompt with administrator permissions, by right-clicking x86 Free Build Environment on the Start menu, and then selecting Run as administrator. At the x86/x64 Free Build Environment command prompt, type the following command on a single line (it appears here on multiple lines for clarity and to fit space limitations). Create a .cat (catalog) file for the driver. We notice that some drivers don't contain a cat file, so we'll need to generate one. Open the .INF file in a text editor. Ensure that under the \[version\] section that you have an entry specifying a .cat file.
