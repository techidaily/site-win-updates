We’re a little late posting this up with all the Holiday madness, but below we’ve provided a list of the new songs included in last week’s Karaoke Cloud Pro update. (in-app karaoke subscription for use with our [Karaoki karaoke software](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/)).

[**Karaoke Cloud Pro**](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) is used by KJs and karaoke venues globally, and with 2 full years of service completed it’s proven to a be a reliable platform for commercial use (legal for public performance). For new KJs and venues just starting out, it’s proven an excellent way to perform right away with an excellent core karaoke library of music — with new music (and some older re-licensed music) being added all the time at no additional cost to subscribers. **Learn more about Karaoke Cloud Pro and sign up for $99 a month [HERE](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/)**
