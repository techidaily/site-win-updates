These programs are called extensions or add-ons; which renders extra powers and features to the browsers’ interface to every page it loads. However, difficulties do happen with these browsers, no matter how well they are programmed.

The issues comprise frequent crash; unnecessary ad pop-ups; unwanted re-directions; security threats; etc. It eventually, they slow down the system’s performance, and hence it needs to be cleared forthwith. The default and accessible way to solve these kinds of problems is to reset the browser to default settings.

It is quite an easy endeavor; however, the default state will almost erase everything.

Resetting doesn’t delete your bookmarks; saved passwords; and sometimes even the browsing history. Hence there is nothing to be worried.

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/4-4.png)

* Now from the slide-out, select the **“Troubleshooting Information”** option**.**

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/4-4.png)

* In the oncoming grey color page, look for the **“Refresh Firefox.” You can find it** in the upper-right corner of the window, under the _Give Firefox a tune-up_, section. Hit the mouse on it.

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/5-3.png)

* Again a dialogue box will appear, where you’ll have to click the **“Refresh Firefox”** button**.**

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/6-3.png)

Now, you have successfully reset the Firefox to its default state. The refresh feature will create a new profile for the users. Firefox will store all of the critical data on the desktop in a new folder, named as “**Old Firefox Data**.”

The steps above will help you to change your browser to its default stage. But still, it won’t delete your data completely; your password and add-ons will stay in your browser, within which specific threats may hide. Hence, the steps above can’t be an ultimate solution, at times.
