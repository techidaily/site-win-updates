## Explore LYRX v1.7 RC - Experience Enhanced Music Curation with Online Songbook Feature!

[![LYRX 1.7 with Karaoke Singer Request Online Songbook](https://i0.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ksr-coverimage-lyrx.jpg?resize=845%2C321&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ksr-coverimage-lyrx.jpg?fit=1030%2C575&ssl=1 "LYRX 1.7 with Karaoke Singer Request Online Songbook")

A release candidate of LYRX 1.7 is available for download and it comes equipped with a new KSR (Karaoke Singer Requests) feature.

The online songbook feature, aka remote singer/song request system, allows karaoke singers to access your songbook from their own web enabled device and make song requests that pop up within the LYRX singer rotation list.

[![LYRX KSR Online Songbook](https://i1.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/LYRX.png?fit=300%2C189&ssl=1 "LYRX KSR Online Songbook")](https://i1.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/LYRX.png?fit=1030%2C650&ssl=1)

The new feature has a name: KSR, or “Karaoke Singer Request”, and we’re ready for more users to download and try it!

Also new in the 1.7 release candidate version of LYRX is a karaoke singers ticker/scroller (scrolled list of singers + custom message) with text color setting. Not only will this scroll your upcoming karaoke sings across the bottom of the screen, but you can add a custom message at the end (eg. wear your mask, special beer offer, etc) Example: Now Appearing: Ryan (Songname), Upcoming: Jane (Songname1), Joe (Songname2), Chris (Songname3) \*\* Wearing your mask is compulsory \*\*.

Please note that this is a “Release Candidate” and features etc. are subject to change. This is also the ‘first release’ of the KSR system, with additional features coming after the initial launch. The total song count the system will host is caped at 100,000 songs for now, more than enough for most karaoke hosts, and eventually an affordable subscription option and tiers will be created.

The screenshots displayed above are of the ‘KSR web app’ that your karaoke singers will use to access your online karaoke songbook and submit song requests. They simply need to visit [ksr.pcdj.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) and create a free account, type in your songbook ID, and they’re ready to browse, search, and send in requests. They also add songs to their own personal ‘Favorites” folder within the web app. Why a web app? No need for your singers to install iOS or Android apps — any web enabled device will work!

Please feel free to test the new KSR system with LYRX 1.7\. If you have issues or suggestions, post them in the [Official PCDJ User Group](http://www.facebook.com/groups/pcdjusergroup/) on Facebook (you will find a pinned thread regarding the new LYRX 1.7 Release Candidate – please post reports in that specific thread).
