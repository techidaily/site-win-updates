![What is Ransomware](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/what-is-ransomware.png)

## What is​ ​Ransomware?

Ransomware is the most advanced malware which locks out your computer device by encrypting all the data. Then, demands money in order to unlock and get access to files.

Only way to get back access is to pay the ransom money demanded by the criminals. In some cases decryptors are available which are the tools to decrypt the files for free. However, not all variants of ransomware can be unlocked this way.

## Where does Ransomware come from?

Email attachments are said to be the most targeted way of spreading ransomware. So, you are likely to get infected by downloading content from spam or unsolicited sender.

​Once, computer gets infected, some ransomware variants have ability to spread across the network of computers connected. ​An example would be Wannacry which took advantage of Windows SMB Server loophole to spread rapidly in small amount of time.

## How to Recognize ​​Ransomware?

Unlike other malware infections, it doesn​’t hide. If your ​computer is infected, you will be welcomed with a ransom demand notice.

​Alert message shown will also clearly mention about the Ransomware variant’s name or you can guess that by encrypted file extensions. Along with that, there is a countdown running with payment information (usually Bitcoin Wallet address) of the criminals.

## How to Remove ​Ransomware?

​It’s quite difficult to remove ransomware infection​. ​Even if you succeed in removing the malicious program, the damage done or the files already encrypted aren’t accessible. 

To decrypt the files and make them accessible, you need a key which is specific to each machine. As mentioned above, Ransomware Decryptors can be helpful in this case if available.
