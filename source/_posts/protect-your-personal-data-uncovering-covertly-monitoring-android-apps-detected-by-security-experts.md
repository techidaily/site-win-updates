## Apps from Unverified Sources

The golden rule of app downloads is this: always get your apps from a reputable source, such as Google Play Store. Why? Apps from unverified sources can often be altered, and the alterations aren’t typically for the better.

Imagine buying a chocolate bar from a dodgy van versus a brightly-lit, reputable grocery store. Both may offer the same product, but which would you trust more? The same principle applies to apps.

However, don’t just download an app because it’s on the Play Store. Take a moment to read the reviews. Previous users’ feedback can save you from potential headaches.

## Document Scanners: Not Just Scanning Papers

You may not be aware, but a popular document scanning app, CamScanner, was discovered to be delivering malware into users’ phones. Kaspersky, a well-known name in the cybersecurity industry, identified a malicious component acting as a Trojan Downloader in this app. 

While the app has since been removed from the Play Store, this incident serves as a stark reminder. Always be vigilant about the apps you choose, even for seemingly harmless tasks like scanning a document.

## Emoji Keyboards: Cute but Potentially Dangerous

Emojis are fun, expressive, and a staple in digital communication. But did you know that they can be potential spyware?

Cybercriminals have found ways to alter the unicode representation or use invisible characters, creating seemingly harmless emojis that can trigger malware downloads, phishing attacks, or unauthorized access to your personal data. 

A popular Android keyboard app was even discovered to be making purchases via hidden code. Talk about a wolf in a digital sheepskin!

## Beauty Camera Apps: More than Skin Deep

Remember the last time you snapped a selfie with a beauty camera app? There’s a chance you were sharing more than just your good looks. 

CyberNews reported that BeautyPlus, a popular beauty camera app with an astonishing 300 million installs, was identified as spyware. Worse still, user data was allegedly sold to servers in China. This certainly isn’t the picture-perfect scenario users had in mind.

The catch with these free apps that gather millions of downloads is the permissions they ask for.

## Social Media Apps: Friend or Foe?

Let’s turn our attention to the apps we use daily to stay connected, like Facebook. Unfortunately, if you’re trying to protect your data, Facebook might be your biggest threat. The scope of their data collection is striking, often surpassing even Google in its intrusiveness. 

And what about other social media platforms like WhatsApp and Instagram? They’re both owned by Facebook, which only increases the risk. Instagram, for example, requests numerous permissions, including reading and modifying your contacts and storage contents, locating your phone, reading your call log, tweaking system settings, and obtaining full network access.

## Almost Every App is a Risk

Here’s a hard pill to swallow – almost all apps pose some risk. Every app installed on your android phone carries trackers and permissions that could potentially compromise your privacy. 

So, **how can you identify these potential [spyware](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/)?** Review the permissions and check the trackers embedded within them.
