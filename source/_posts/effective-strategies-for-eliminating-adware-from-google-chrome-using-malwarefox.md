The following steps illustrates the procedures to remove/disable adware related extensions that you don’t use.

* Open the Google Chrome and click on the “Chrome menu” (the three horizontal dots at the top right corner). A drop-down will menu appear now. Select “More tools” from it and click on the “Extension” option from it.​
