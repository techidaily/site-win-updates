## Per-user versus Per-machine installations

One of the most important decisions that IT professionals must make when deploying software on Windows machines is whether to use a per-user or per-machine installation. 

Both installation methods have advantages and disadvantages, and selecting the correct method can have a significant impact on application performance, security, and user experience. In general, in managed environments, the per-machine installation is preferred.

### What are per-user installations?

**Per-user installations** are intended to install an application only for the current logged-in user. This means that the application will be available only to that user and will not be accessible to other users who log in to the same machine. 

Per-user installations are commonly used for applications that aren't meant to be shared by multiple users or machines, such as personal productivity tools or small utilities.

A great mention in the per-user area in terms of installer technologies is MSIX. MSIX is a newer packaging format introduced by Microsoft in Windows 10 version 1709\. Unlike traditional MSI packages, which support both per-user and per-machine installations, **MSIX is only intended for use with per-user installations**.

MSIX packages are specifically designed to support per-user installations, with an emphasis on providing end-users with a streamlined and reliable installation experience. The format makes use of a number of advanced features and technologies, such as containerization and virtualization, to ensure that applications are correctly installed and configured, even in complex and diverse IT environments.

One of MSIX's primary advantages is that it provides a more secure and efficient method of installing and managing applications on Windows machines. MSIX packages are isolated from other applications on the system by using containerization technology, which helps to prevent conflicts and compatibility issues.

### What are per-machine installations?

In contrast, **per-machine installations** are intended to install an application for all users who log in to a specific machine. This means that the application will be accessible to all users of the machine, regardless of who installed it originally. 

Per-machine installations are typically used for enterprise applications that require all users in an organization to have access to them, such as office suites or line-of-business applications.

Each installation type has advantages and disadvantages. Because they do not require administrative privileges and can be installed by the user without assistance from IT, per-user installations are frequently simpler and easier to manage. 

Per-user installations, on the other hand, can be more difficult to manage in a large-scale environment because they necessitate individual installation and configuration for each user.

Per-machine installations are more complicated and necessitate administrative privileges. They are also less secure because they grant access to the application and its files to all users on the machine. 

Per-machine installations are easier to manage in a large-scale environment because they can be deployed and configured once for all users.
