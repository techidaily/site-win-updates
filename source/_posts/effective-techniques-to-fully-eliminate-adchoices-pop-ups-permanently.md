## Effective Techniques to Fully Eliminate AdChoices Pop-Ups Permanently

A large part of the Internet monetization is through advertisements. From large companies to small business owners earn from ads. Even digital entrepreneurs get a significant portion of their revenue from ads. For example, Invesp [reported](https://www.invespcro.com/blog/effectiveness-online-advertising/) that 95% of Google’s revenue comes from online advertising. That is a considerable percentage of their income.

## What is AdChoice?

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/1-1.png)

[AdChoices](http://youradchoices.com/) is a self-regulatory program governing online advertisements. This self-regulatory program implements in the United States, Canada, and different parts of Europe. It establishes and enforces companies to practice ethical methods in online advertising. Which includes collecting data and transparency.

Companies adhere to principles set forth by different regulatory institutions. They follow the [Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) AdChoices Principles](http://youradchoices.com/principles) for America. Canada has the [Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (DAAC) AdChoices Principles](https://youradchoices.ca/). And, the [European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) AdChoices Principles](http://www.edaa.eu/european-principles/) in Europe.

There are over 200 company participants in AdChoices self-regulatory programs. Giants like AOL, AT&T, Bloomberg, Google, and Microsoft are participating. Local companies from Canda and Europe also follow the principles in their respective AdChoices programs.

## What Advertisements does it Affect?

Principles followed by the companies under AdChoices deploy “interest-based” advertising. They collect data such as your advertising habits, browsing, history, and other personal information to target specific adverts to appear while you are browsing. It has become a privacy concern for a lot of customers.

Examples of principles followed by advertisers and companies are avoiding Flash cookies. The US and Canadian AdChoices programs deem Flash as an unsecured method and require participating companies to avoid using it.

## Is AdChoice Malware?

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/malware.png)

No. AdChoices is a program followed by the companies and related bodies. When you click the AdChoices icon on an advertisement, you will see how companies “personalize” the ads. You can learn more about the ad’s or websites’ collection practices. It also provides options for you to opt-out of the program.

You should note that by opting-out, you do not necessarily block advertisements. It also does not prevent websites from tracking your browsing habits. And, in most cases, opting-out is not as effective as it should.

Advertisements and AdChoices are helpful when done right. They point you to the right product which hopefully something that you might need. It crosses the line when applications install adware on your computer.

Many installers bundle such kind of programs. It slows down your system, and you begin receiving pop-ups and redirections. Unfortunately, ads are known to redirect users to malicious websites.

## How to Remove AdChoices PopUps?

There are ways to remove yourself from AdChoices. Follow the guidelines below.

### Opting Out in Google

You can opt-out of AdChoices in Google if you don’t have to see personalized ads, but still want to receive general advertisements.

Login to your **[Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/),** then, head over to your **[Ads Settings](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated)**. Toggle the switch next to **Ads Personalization**.

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2-1.png)

A pop-up window will open. Confirm by clicking **Turn Off**.

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/3-1.png)

Scroll down to the bottom and click on **Opt Out of More Ads**.

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/4-1.png)

It will take you to the official AdChoices window. It will scan your system first.

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/5-1.png)

Then, read the note about the browser tool and click **Continue**.

You will see a list of companies under AdChoices, and you can select which ones you want running.

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/7.png)

Note that opting out does not block or stop ads altogether. It doesn’t disable personalized ads from companies as well. It only works on ads running on Google. Additionally, if you log-out of your Google Account, using another browser, or deleted cookies, you may need to opt out again.

## Blocking Advertisements

You can block pop-up AdChoices and most ads using browser extensions. It protects you from accidentally clicking on ads. Some ad blockers may even remove Youtube advertisements.

### AdGuard

Opted out, reset, changed ad id and opted out again. Disabled chrome and installed Firefox privacy browser. Ran malware bytes, Trojan scanner, stopped apps from drawing over the system, uninstalled all possible apps besides the ones that came with my s8\. Ads popping up on screen over everything I do on my phone. Finally reset the whole phone ads still there. I have depression and sometimes need my phone for sensory issues. Used YouTube all the time for background mediation music, now I can’t because the ads are popping up over the app and stopping the play of music. I thought this was my phone. I opted out now what?  
Any answers would be great thank you

   Sahra, I am recovering from heart surgery and this crappy service kept blowing up my phone both in and out of the hospital. I suffer from other illness and this problem has become life threatening.  
   I thinks it’s time to speak to our respective State Attorney General’s offices and inquire about the possibility of class action lawsuits.  
   No one should be forced to suffer continued damage to their health or be forced to jump through hoops in order protect oneself.  
   Every company affiliated with these services should feel shame.

         First time i saw it when i was running on threadmill. when i am running i am using heartbeat sensor with indication on my smatrphone. So I am running on the edge (190 bpm) and this advert has come – so it caused me to risk of my life because when i am trying to turn off this advert i cant seу my heartbeat rhythm and it also thrown off me… I think this type of advert can be harmfull and those people who make this must pay for this

                              Clem, he is using an app for his running! It wasn’t like he was checking text messages. Treadmills these days have a place for you to set your phone where you can view it – it is no different than watching tv as you run on a treadmill. Some of those apps are audio and don’t even require you to actually look at the phone. Read people’s comments in full before criticizing.

   DAA, Adchoices, Network Advertising initiatives, youronlinechoices, Evidon, Trustarc etc websites claim that by switching the 100’s even 1000’s of ad agents cookies off on these websites it does not block all ads, only targetted ads or interest based ads.  
   You can only alter those cookie settings in normal mode in Chrome saved permanently, as long as you set clearing history to not clear cookies. Keep it unticked.

   I’m at my wits end and ready to boycott every company I see an ad come up for. Do they really think this is going to make you want to shop with them?! I just don’t get it. For me, it’s more than just a nuisance – it is quite costly. I live in a rural area with no high speed internet so I have to get my internet from a hot spot and only get 12GB/mo for all devices (phones, laptops) in our household. These ads constantly running gobble up my data like PacMan. It really should be illegal. At the very least, there should be a simple way to opt out. I have been researching for months and have yet to have any of the posted solutions work for me. :'(

What I want to know is, how do you block the server where the Adchoices comes from? What I mean is, if there’s an IP address, I would go into my router, and then add that IP address in the block list, so if Adchoices is coming from, just for example, 128.0.0.1, and I put that IP address in the block list in the router, what is supposed to happen is effectively block that IP address so that I no longer get anything from Adchoices.  
Is this possible, to just block whatever server or IP the Adchoices is coming from?

I’ve opted out all companies in Ad Choices…and I’m still getting Google ad pop ups. I tried a couple of pop up blockers from Google Play and they didnt work, so Deleted the aps and now I’m getting pop ups from those companies. The pop ups come once a minute and I am forced to close each one to continue using phone. WTF…?? Help please.

This is the same with my phone. Works if you reset the phone to factory. But will come back. Google Ads should be sued for this blatant abuse and have a SINGLE button to turn this sh\*t off.  
Only option. Get an Iphone.

My nephew’s Samsung tablet is doing the constant ad choice pop ups. He is 7 and is frustrated. Every game he tries, it gets stopped by these ads, constantly. Having read the above complaints, I will definitely not be buying a Samsung phone or tablet, of which I was really looking just recently. I will remain with Apple. It’s wrong to make people endure this bs. Hopefully, many more will complain and Google will find other ways to make money. But, as for now, they have lost a would-be customer!

Today I spent 4 hours on the phone with Google Fi. They have exhausted everything they know about how to ride my phone of these AdChoice ads popping up continuously on my Android PixelXl. No answer except factory reset!!! And that is not guaranteed to work.

I would like to be paid for the time I spend everyday waiting for these ads to load and then closing them. I would also like to be paid for the time spent trying to figure out how to remove them from my phone. If I don’t want them, please offer me an easy way to opt out. Otherwise, I’m being violated. Not only is it emotional frustrating, it physically causes my blood pressure to sky rocket. And I’m a laid back, nice and respectful mom. I have sat and tried to remove this annoying adchoice while not even noticing it’s become dark outside and I haven’t made dinner yet. That is my problem of course, but it shouldn’t have to take time away from my work and family. It feels like a stranger is ringing my doorbell at home, trying to sell me something 30 times a day. I’d call the police. They’d be arrested. How is this legal?

To block all these annoying adds needs some work on your router. What you have to do is go into IP and port filtering and add three new rules…  
Rule : Source : Destination (range) : rest of options ALL  
1 : ALL : 74.125.193.150 – 74.125.193.159  
2 : ALL : 216.58.209.90 – 216.58.209.99  
3 : ALL : 209.85.202.150 – 209.85.202.159  
This blocks your devices at home from seeing these Add sites. As a result, the add servers can serve all they like but you will not see and/or download them.  
You can, if you wish, add the site names / addresses to each individual hosts file on your device. This will blacklist these sites to your device = same result, you will not see the adds.  
Companies will eventually realize that we, as users, do not want to be pestered with adds etc, and since the devices are ours, we can chose to block them. If adds that are being paid for by are not been seen, the suppliers will go to elsewhere, and these ‘add pestering companies’ will eventually close.

It is not possible to block all these adds from AdChoices unless you chose to block Google. I, a IT developer with 40+ years tried to block individual ip addresses to stop these adds and it works for about 2 mins but then fails… the server just chooses another ip address in the range of 209.85.128.0 – 209.85.255.255 (which is the range that Google uses.) The only way to block these adds completely is block everything coming from google… and it is something I am looking into.

I found a way to block these ‘AdChoices’ …. go to a site either directly or via another search engine provider other than Google, and block Google on your router / hosts file.

If you have randomly a screen filling pop-up advertisement from AdChoixes on your Android it is probably coming from the app “Rose Photo Editor”. Remove this App and you are freed from these pop-ups.  
If you can’t find it on your phone, go the Google playstore and find the app there. If it is installed on your phone you can remove it here !

AdChoices ads obscure articles making them unreadable. When I encounter an AdChoices advertisement, I immediately close the browser, angered at both the advertiser and the product for having made my investment in computer equipment and bandwidth less valuable. AdChoices ads are FAR MORE INVASIVE than any other ads I see, and I believe their tactics of preventing use of web pages to be illegal.

I don’t mind text ads that don’t obscure articles and that don’t distract my ability to read articles, but ads that cover up content I’m trying to read, require a response to continue reading, display unwanted video or audio should be illegal. They steal bandwidth, but more costly to me, they steal my attention. Keep ads out of articles in peripheral areas of the screen, and I will never object to them or attempt to block them, but distract me in any way or demand a response to continue reading, and I block the website that sponsors those ads every time it happens.

FYI from a security expert- Most apps have what “people” would call back doors that install add serveries without your permission. The ONLY way to ensure you don’t have malware is to NOT install any apps. Go to the web page, don’t use the app. If you bank has an app, there is a good chance it is safe. Even the best apps get bought by malicious actors that update them to do malicious things. This is common practice. There are a few pieces of malware for phones that even survive a hard reset, but it is your best option if you are compromised.
