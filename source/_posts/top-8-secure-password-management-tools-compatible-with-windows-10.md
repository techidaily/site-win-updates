## What is a Password Manager?

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/idea-xxl.png)

_A password manager is primarily a software or a program that is an excellent utility for securing your online identity and sensitive data online._ For starters, a password manager can create secure passwords for multiple accounts you hold and memorize it for you. These strong passwords will act as a shield protecting you from cyber attacks and hackers.

Further, it organizes these strong passwords at one place which can be either a cloud-storage, local storage or a removable disk. These password managers also remember all your information by filling in the credentials automatically when you wish to log in to any app or website. Moreover, the best password managers in the market have many advanced features as well.

These out-of-the-box features include cross-platform support, cross-browser sync, and multifactor authentication, to name just a few. Many password managers also audit your existing passwords to ensure they are secure enough to use online.

In case, your account gets compromised, it can also replace the old password with a new one to prevent further damage.

Now, that I have covered just about everything a password manager can do for you, I think it would be wise for you to invest in a good password manager that comes with additional security tools like encryption mechanism for sharing your password with emergency contacts and organize your passwords in a secure place.

Let’s start with the list of the best password managers for Windows 10 to secure your passwords and memorize them effortlessly.

**Why should I use a password manager?** 

If you tends to forget passwords and could not create a strong password than a password manager can do that for you. A good Password Manager can lower your burden of remembering and filling the login details on your different account.

**Can my password manager get hacked?** 

It is very DIFFICULT to hack a password manager since most of them uses a strong 256-bit AES, or equivalent encryption method. A hacker would need an extraordinarily powerful supercomputer to steal your data. BUT, if your master password is weak then your password vault could be hacked easily.

Thank. I just bought roboform, I’ve used Roboform, Dashlane, LastPass and KeePass. Roboform seems the best for me, Dashlane is good but too expensive, LastPass is good but their Windows App is very bad so you don’t have autofill for windows apps and KeePass is free but you have to do a lot of stuff manually.

I had free RoboForm. Then it became $23.88/month. Could not talk with them so, finally, cancelled it with GREAT difficulty.

Dashlane has killed off their desktop app. It’s now a browser extension only, and in January of 2022 if you have the desktop application, they will lock you out of it.

In January 2022 DASLANE will stop support for the windows desktop version in favor of the browser version. With desktop applications that require passwords you will have to do a cut/paste off the web version to satisfy that need. BAD SELLING POINT compared to the other products.

Dashlane has pissed me off with there cancelation of the desktop app, especially when the browser extension doesnt have a VPN option. They also keep raising the price, if I could find a better alternative I would switch, but sadly they still have the best features and trying to move all my passwords would be too difficult. I think us Dashlane customers need to Force Dashlane into keeping the desktop app, I thought at least they would leave it without updating but with the full on cancelation and losing the PC VPN I feel like they are really screwing customers over to save a few bucks while raking us over the coals.
