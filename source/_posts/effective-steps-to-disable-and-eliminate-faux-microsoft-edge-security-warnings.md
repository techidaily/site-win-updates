## Effective Steps to Disable and Eliminate Faux Microsoft Edge Security Warnings

Last year Microsoft released its new variant of Edge, which is based on the robust [Chromium](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) engine. With the latest development, many users switch to the newest Edge, forgetting its past.

Though the new Edge is an advanced and secure browser, some users are receiving the fake virus warning through a pop-up when browsing the internet on Edge. This virus scam claims that the user’s system is infected with a virus, and cybercriminals are leaking much personal information like Credit Card details and others.

![Edge Fake pop up](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Edge-fake-pop-up.png)

The whole [scam](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) is carried out by the cyberattackers who pretend to be from the Microsoft support team. They ask users to call on a specific number to get the solution. Such pop-ups usually occur when a potentially unwanted program such as Adware infiltrates the device. They might also appear through some infected sites.

Sometimes along with popping the fake warning, the browsing screen also freezes down, making users unable to close the tab or browser.

Other than scamming, the Edge browser is also used for infecting devices with malware programs and redirecting users to harmful websites. 

It is essential to get rid of the source behind this fake virus alert from Microsoft Edge. In this post, we would list out several methods to remove the Microsoft Edge virus alert.

## How to remove fake virus alert in Microsoft Edge?

Here are a few ways to remove the fake Microsoft Edge virus alert:

### **Restart your PC in Safe Mode**

Windows Safe Mode is the perfect environment to find out and solve the critical errors in the system. In safe mode, only system programs and some crucial programs run. Safe mode would most likely kill the applications and its files that try to run automatically on your system. [Follow this guide to boot your Windows 10 PC in **Safe Mode**](https://www.windowschimp.com/how-to-boot-windows-10-into-safe-mode/)**.**

### **Uninstall Suspicious Applications**

If the Microsoft Edge virus alert pop-up still appears on your PC, try to find the culprit application and uninstall it. 

1. Right-click on the taskbar and select the **Task Manager**.  
![Open Task Manager](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Open-Task-Manger.png)
2. Watch out for the applications that are consuming the system memory even though you did not install or launch them.
3. Right-click on the suspicious application and open its file location.  
![uninstall suspicous files](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/uninstall-suspicous-files.png)
4. Delete the file from its root location.
5. Open Control Panel and click on **Uninstall a program** and check for suspicious apps. One by one, select and uninstall them.![uninstall the apps](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/uninstall-the-apps.png)

### **Delete Temporary Files**

The temporary files folder can also be a carrier of malicious files. Thus, we recommend deleting all the temporary files and folders regularly for the smooth running of the system. Removing the temporary files would also clear the unnecessary clutter from your system and free-up the valuable space.

Here are the steps to eliminate thre temporary files:

1. Open the Run command window.
2. Type **%temp%** and hit the enter key.![temp run command](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/temp-run-command.png)
3. This run command would navigate you to this path: **_C:\\Users\\\[username\]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp,_** that is, the temp folder.

4. Select all Files and Folders of this folder and delete them. Don’t hesitate to delete them, as they are not essential for any of your tasks. ![Delete temp files](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Delete-temp-files.png)
5. Next right-click on the **Recycle Bin** and select **Empty Recycle Bin.**![Empty recycle bin](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Empty-recycle-bin.jpg)

### **Clear Browsing Data**

Clearing the browsing data such as history, cookies, cached data, and others might fix the fake pop-up issue. Here are the steps to do that:

1. Launch the Edge browser.
2. Click on the three-dots at the top-right corner and select **Settings**.![Edge browser settings](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Edge-browser-settings.png)
3. On the left pane of the Settings page, click on **Privacy, search, and services**.![privacy settings edge browser](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/privacy-settings-edge-browser.png)

4. Scroll down and under **Clear browsing data,** click on **Choose what to clear** button.![choose what to clear](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/choose-what-to-clear.png)
5. Select Browsing History, Download History, Cache, Cookies, and other data, choose the appropriate Time range, and click on the **Clear now** button.![clear edge data](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/clear-edge-data.png)

## Final Words

For the users, the fake pop-up warning can be scary, especially the way it suddenly appears. Still, users must think thoroughly without panicking and never call the bogus number provided by the attackers to get the solution. When the user calls the given number, the attacker pretending to be tech support will ask them to install a fake malicious program to remove the virus. The intruder might also ask the callers to pay for the tech support and the phony virus removal program. It is advised never to call on the number and follow the instructions provided by the fake tech support. Instead, follow the solutions listed in this post and remove the fake Edge virus alert from the device.

**Is Microsoft Edge a virus?** 

No, Edge is a popular and legit browser designed by the reputed software developer organization Microsoft. However, this legitimate browser can be maligned by hijacking its settings and redirecting users to malicious sites and pop-ups.

**Why am I getting a warning from Microsoft edge?** 

The virus warning pop-up on the Microsoft Edge might be because of an adware present on your system. It might also be because of malicious website redirection.

Unfortunately, got the dreaded popup this evening. I used “Clear Browsing Data” and got rid of it. Then I used “Delete Temporary Files” just to make sure. Thanks very much for your help. I can now get some sleep.

In macOS, I received one of these on my google chrome browser. All you have to do is get the website that is doing it and search it up in your chrome notification setting. Then, you can click delete cookies and it will go away.

Your suggestions seemed to have helped! Restarting in “safe mode” was kinda scary, and didn’t take care of the problem; but as I made my way thru the list, the notifications stopped. Thanks for mentioning “not to panic” too, btw… cause I definitely was :p
