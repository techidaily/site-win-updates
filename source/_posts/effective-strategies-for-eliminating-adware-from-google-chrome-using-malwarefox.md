## Chrome Adware Removal Procedure

### Method-1: Remove Adware Related Extensions from Google Chrome

Almost all the latest browsers will support extensions (addons), and the Chrome is no different. But there are some bad extensions that will pose a real threat to privacy. 

For example, programs like antivirus can often install their own browser extensions without your permission. Therefore, analysing the extensions manually and removing the weird ones, can help to eliminate the risks. The following steps illustrates the procedures to remove/disable adware related extensions that you don’t use.

* Open the Google Chrome and click on the “Chrome menu” (the three horizontal dots at the top right corner). A drop-down will menu appear now. Select “More tools” from it and click on the “Extension” option from it.​
