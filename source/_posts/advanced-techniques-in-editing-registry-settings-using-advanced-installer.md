## Manipulating of registry classes with Advanced Installer

Advanced Installer supports working with COM components extensively, including the ability to define custom interfaces, type libraries, and classes. The Advanced Installer GUI can be used to define and register these components.

One of the primary advantages of using Advanced Installer for COM component work is its ability to generate registry entries and other configuration data automatically based on the information defined in the installation package. This can greatly simplify the process of creating and managing COM components, particularly in complex applications requiring multiple components and interfaces.

Advanced Installer offers two separate pages for the users to work with different types of classes. When it comes to COM components, Interfaces, Type Libraries and COM+ components, you can define this information directly into the GUI by navigating to the [COM Page](https://tools.techidaily.com/advancedinstaller/products/).

![ai com page](https://cdn.advancedinstaller.com/img/registry-classes-with-advanced-installer/ai-com-page.png "ai com page")  

When it comes to File Type Associations, Advanced Installer offers a separate GUI where you can define these and this can be found in the [File Associations Page](https://tools.techidaily.com/advancedinstaller/products/).

![ai file associations page](https://cdn.advancedinstaller.com/img/registry-classes-with-advanced-installer/ai-file-associations-page.png "ai file associations page")  

### COM Page

Advanced Installer includes a number of useful tools for working with COM components, such as the ability to create new classes, interfaces, and type libraries. These tools are accessible via the Advanced Installer interface's "COM, Interfaces, COM+, Type Libraries" panel, which allows developers and system administrators to easily create, edit, and manage COM components for use in their applications.

Simply click the corresponding toolbar button, tree context menu item, or keyboard shortcut to add a new class, interface, or type library. To add a new class, for example, while the "COM, Interfaces, COM+, Type Libraries" panel is focused, click the "New Class" button or press the Insert key. Similarly, use the "New Interface" or "New Type Library" toolbar buttons to add a new interface or type library.

![ai com page nav menu](https://cdn.advancedinstaller.com/img/registry-classes-with-advanced-installer/ai-com-page-nav-menu.png "ai com page nav menu")  

Advanced Installer includes tools for editing and deleting existing components in addition to adding new ones. Use the "Rename" tree context menu item or press the F2 key while the element is selected to rename it. Use the "Delete" toolbar button, the "Delete" tree context menu item, or the Delete key while the element is selected to delete it.

![ai com page rename](https://cdn.advancedinstaller.com/img/registry-classes-with-advanced-installer/ai-com-page-rename.png "ai com page rename")  

Advanced Installer also includes tools for importing COM+ components and converting type libraries for more advanced tasks. Use the "Import COM+" toolbar button or context menu item to import a COM+ component. Use the "Convert Type Library" toolbar button or tree context menu item to convert a type library. When converting a type library, the COM registration registries contained within the file are extracted and silently imported into the Registry page, bypassing the TypeLib table.

### COM Properties

Once a COM component has been added to the project, the properties tab view allows you to specify the [settings of that particular COM](https://tools.techidaily.com/advancedinstaller/products/).

![ai com properties tab](https://cdn.advancedinstaller.com/img/registry-classes-with-advanced-installer/ai-com-properties-tab.png "ai com properties tab")  

The interface in the view is simple and straightforward, allowing IT professionals to easily configure the settings for their installation package. When registering COM files with Advanced Installer, you have several options:

* General Settings: The "General" tab displays some general information about the COM file that is being registered. You can specify the file to be registered, the server context, and the threading model here. You can also give the COM file a description and a version number.
* ProgId and VerIndepProgId: You can specify the Program IDs associated with the Class ID using the "ProgId" and "VerIndepProgId" options. Advanced Installer's File Associations page is where program IDs are defined. You can also specify a version-independent Program ID in the Installer Project's File Associations or Registry page.
* TypeLib Id: You can enter the ID of the TypeLibrary that describes the COM here. This option is especially useful when dealing with a large number of COM files.
* Display and Options: The "Display" and "Options" tabs allow you to specify various settings related to the appearance and behavior of the COM file. You can select an icon that will be associated with the CLSID, specify the file type mask, and select the default in-process handler for the server context.
* Argument and Feature: The "Argument" and "Feature" options are related to the CLSID keys LocalServer or LocalServer32\. The "Argument" option allows you to register a text as the server's argument, which is used by COM to invoke the server. The "Feature" option lets you choose which feature provides the COM server.
* Relative Path and Location: Finally, you can specify whether the register path is relative or absolute, as well as the registry location where the COM is registered, using the "Relative Path" and "Location" options. The registry location for COMs defined through the MSI Class table is read-only.

### COM ActiveX Properties

If the COM has any ActiveX settings, you can easily configure them in the [ActiveX Properties Tab](https://tools.techidaily.com/advancedinstaller/products/).

![ai com activex tab](https://cdn.advancedinstaller.com/img/registry-classes-with-advanced-installer/ai-com-activex-tab.png "ai com activex tab")

ActiveX is a subset of COM that is designed specifically for use in web browsers, whereas COM is a more general-purpose technology used to create software components that can be used by any application.

ActiveX controls are essentially a type of COM component that is specifically designed to work within a web browser. Typically, these controls are used to add functionality to a website or web application, such as displaying multimedia content or interacting with user input. They are built with the same technologies and techniques as other COM components, but with some web-specific features and restrictions.

When looking over the ActiveX view, you have the following options:

* ActiveX Controls: ActiveX controls are a type of COM component that can be used to add interactive features to web pages or desktop applications. When registering an ActiveX control, it is important to mark it as such in the properties.
* Programmable COMs: Programmable COMs are COM components that can be used in programming languages such as Visual Basic and C++. Registering a programmable COM requires specifying it as such in the properties.
* Insertable Objects: Insertable objects are a type of COM component that can be inserted into other applications, such as a Word document. When registering an insertable object, it is important to indicate that objects of this class should appear in the Insert Object dialog box list box when used by COM container applications.

Additional Properties: Aside from these main properties, there are several other properties that can be defined when registering a COM. These include:

* Toolbox: This specifies the 16x16 bitmap to use for the face of a toolbar or toolbox button.
* Misc Status: This property specifies how to create and display an object, the desired data or view aspect of the object when drawing or getting data.
* Extensions: This property is used to register the control as the viewer for specified extensions.
* Implemented Categories: This property is used to specify the categories this COM implements.

To define new Implemented Categories, you can use the "New" button, the "Add" combobox, or the "Add" context menu. There are also predefined implemented categories, such as "Implemented in .NET", "Safe for scripting", and "Safe for initializing".

### DCOM Properties

If you wish to configure and register DCOM servers, you can easily input a GUID to transform it into a Distributed COM. This can be done in the [AppID Tab](https://tools.techidaily.com/advancedinstaller/products/).

![ai com appid tab](https://cdn.advancedinstaller.com/img/registry-classes-with-advanced-installer/ai-com-appid-tab.png "ai com appid tab")  

DCOM is a Microsoft technology that allows software components to communicate with one another directly over a network. It is a Component Object Model (COM) extension that provides the infrastructure for developing distributed applications. DCOM enables remote access to components over a network and allows developers to create applications that are distributed across multiple machines.

DCOM follows a client-server model, in which the client sends a request to the server, which processes the request and returns a response to the client. The client and server can communicate using a variety of protocols, including TCP/IP, UDP, HTTP, and HTTPS.

DCOM is commonly used in enterprise settings where applications must be distributed across multiple servers and workstations. It enables developers to create distributed applications that can be easily scaled to meet business requirements. However, installing and configuring DCOM can be difficult, requiring a thorough understanding of the underlying network infrastructure.

The AppId value can be specified in the General section of the AppId Properties tab. This value is written to the CLSID and generates the AppId GUID key in HKCR\\AppId.

The AppId Properties tab's Properties section contains several fields that allow you to configure the DCOM server. The Remote Server Name field is a Formatted Type field that will be written under HKCR\\AppID{AppID}. The Local Service field specifies the local service that will be stored in the HKCR\\AppID{AppID} field. The Service Parameters field specifies which service parameters will be stored under HKCR\\AppID{AppID}. The Dll Surrogate field specifies the Dll surrogate that will be stored in the HKCR\\AppID{AppID} folder, and this field is usually left blank.

The Active At Storage checkbox is used to enable the "ActivateAtStorage"="Y" value, which is stored in HKCR\\AppID{AppID}. The Run As Interactive User checkbox allows you to tell the DCOM server to run as an interactive user. This value will be written as "RunAs"="Interactive User" under HKCR\\AppID{AppID}.

### Interface Properties
