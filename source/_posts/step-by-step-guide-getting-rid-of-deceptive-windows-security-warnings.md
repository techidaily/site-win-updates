## Step-by-Step Guide: Getting Rid of Deceptive Windows Security Warnings

While browsing the internet, many Windows users come across a critical warning pop-up, “Windows Security Alert.” This security message claims to be from Microsoft alerting its user of a malware attack. However, that is not true, and the error message is purely a scam, quite similar to the “[This Computer is Blocked](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/)” scam.

## What is “Windows Security Alert”?

“Windows Security Alert” is a fake warning pop-up that Windows users get when they visit any malicious site. This pop-up scam is basically a social engineering attack to trick users into calling a fraud tech support number. This is the message that a user receives in the form of a fake alert.

support.windows.com says:
**** Windows Security Alert** 

Internet Security Alert! Code: 055BCCAC9FEC

Do not ignore this critical alert.

If you close this page, your device access will de disabled to prevent 
further damage to our network.
Your device has alerted us that it has been infected with a 
Suspicious Activity. The following information is being stolen:
        > Facebook logins
        > Credit Card details
        > Email Account Login
        > Photos stored on this device

Please call us immediately at: _**+1 844 885 0155**_

You must contact us immediately so that our engineers can walk you 
through the removal process over the phone. Please call us within 
the next 5 minutes to prevent your device from being disabled.

Such faux alert frightens the users who receive them, and in anticipation of getting a solution, they call the fake number. After reaching the bogus number, the scammer pretending to be a tech expert provides fake solutions to fix the problem and asks for payment in the form of solution fees. Scammers can also perform many hazardous tasks like asking for remote access to your system, taking your private details, suggesting downloading malware-infected programs to fix the issue, and many more.

Windows users should never pay attention to such fake pop-up messages as following its instructions can cause many troubles. It is essential to know that Microsoft never includes any number in the error message. In fact, Microsoft would never ask its user to call them and then ask for private information such as bank details.

## Why did I get the “Windows Security Alert” Pop-Up?

If you see the “Windows Security Alert” pop-up message on your screen, it might be because of one of the following reasons:

* You might have visited an infected website while looking for freeware or similar things on the internet.
* Your system might be infected with an adware program, which is causing irrelevant ads and pop-ups on your browsing screen.
* The browser you are using might be tainted with ill-disposed malware known as Browser Hijacker. A browser hijacker can take control of your browser’s settings and redirect you to infected sites.
* Many users blindly install the software programs without unchecking the bundled programs that come with the installer. Cybercriminals often introduce malware such as Adware and trojans through the bundled programs.

## How to Fix “Windows Security Alert” Virus alert?

If you are dealing with this message or pop-up repeatedly, you have to get rid of the root cause redirecting this fake message to you.

Here are the steps for that:

### **Restart your PC in Safe Mode**

Windows Safe Mode is the perfect environment to find out and solve critical errors in the system. In safe mode, only system programs and some crucial programs run. Safe mode would most likely kill the applications and their files that try to run automatically on your system.

### **Delete Temporary Files**

The temporary files folder can also be a carrier of malicious files. Thus, we recommend deleting all the temporary files and folders regularly for the smooth running of the system. Removing the temporary files would also clear the unnecessary clutter from your system and free up valuable space.

Here are the steps to eliminate the temporary files:

1. Open the Run command window.
2. Type **%temp%** and hit the enter key.![temp run command](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/temp-run-command.png)
3. This run command would navigate you to this path: **_C:\\Users\\\[username\]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp,_** that is, the temp folder.

## How to Avoid such Threats?

It is essential to avoid “Windows Security Alert” and other such threats so that you do not have to deal with them. Here are some tips for that:

1. Never fall into the trap of attractive pop-ups and banner ads.
2. Always ignore award-giving web pages and emails. Never click on the links they carry.

**Is the “Windows Security Alert” a Scam by Microsoft?** 

NO. Microsoft is a reputed and one of the biggest software development companies in the world. The cyber attackers take advantage of its trusted name to spread fake alerts like “Windows Security Alert.”

Microsoft never blocks any computer. You see the warning of “Microsoft has blocked your computer” because malware might have got an entry on your system and triggered the fake message to spread the spam.
