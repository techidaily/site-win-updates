## What is Application Repackaging

Repackaging plays an important role in organizations' software lifecycle management by enabling efficient deployment, customization, and maintenance of software applications.

### Key Concepts in Software Repackaging

Capturing an existing software installation, transforming it into an installer package, and customizing it to meet specific deployment requirements are all part of the process. While adhering to best practices and compliance standards, repackaging ensures consistent and reliable installations.

Some of the key concepts in Repackaging consist of:

* **Application Capture**: Monitoring the changes made to the system during the installation is part of the process of capturing an existing software installation. It records data such as file and registry changes, system settings, and dependencies. The collected data is used to create the installer package.
* **Transformation**: Once the application is captured, it needs to be transformed into an installer package format. This involves converting the captured data into a structured format compatible with industry-standard installation technologies such as Windows Installer (MSI).
* **Customization**: Customizations to the captured application can be applied through repackaging. Modifying installation settings, adding registry entries, configuring application parameters, defining file associations, and incorporating specific deployment requirements are all examples of this. Customizations ensure that the packaged application adheres to organizational policies as well as user preferences.
* **Quality Assurance**: Quality assurance is critical in repackaging, as it is in any software development process. It entails putting the packaged application through its paces to ensure its functionality, compatibility, and adherence to organizational standards. Installation testing, user acceptance testing, and compatibility checks with various operating systems and configurations are examples of quality assurance activities.
* **Version Control**: Version control of packaged applications is also involved in repackaging. Version control ensures that changes to installer packages are tracked and documented properly over time. It allows organizations to revert to previous versions if problems arise, as well as keep a history of package changes for auditing and compliance purposes.

### Benefits on walking on the Repackaging path

Although repackaging might take additional time to perform than to just take the MSI directly from the vendor website, there are many benefits on walking on the repackaging path:

* **Streamlined Deployment**: By providing standardized installer packages that can be easily distributed across multiple machines, repackaging simplifies the deployment process. It ensures consistent installations and saves time and effort on manual installations and configurations.
* **Customization and Configuration**: By incorporating specific customizations, configurations, or additional components, repackaging enables tailor-made installations. This allows organizations to meet specific deployment needs and deliver applications that are optimized for their environments.
* **Compatibility and Dependency Management**: Repackaging aids in the resolution of compatibility issues and the management of application dependencies. It ensures that applications run smoothly on target machines without conflicts or missing prerequisites by capturing and packaging the necessary components and dependencies.
* **Software Maintenance and Updates**: Repackaging makes software maintenance and updates easier. It enables organizations to efficiently package and distribute new versions or patches of applications across their infrastructure, ensuring consistent and timely updates.
* **Standardization and Compliance**: By adhering to established packaging practices and guidelines, repackaging promotes standardization. It ensures that applications are packaged consistently, in accordance with compliance standards and organizational policies. This aids in the maintenance of a secure and compliant IT environment.

### Best practices in Repackaging

As with any other area in IT, there are some best practices in repackaging that we suggest you follow:

* **Documentation**: Documenting the repackaging process is critical for keeping track of the steps taken, the customizations used, and any known issues or workarounds. Documentation is essential for troubleshooting, knowledge sharing, and ensuring consistent repackaging practices.
* **Testing and Validation**: It is critical to thoroughly test and validate packaged applications to ensure their functionality and compatibility. It is recommended that comprehensive testing be performed on various operating systems, configurations, and deployment scenarios before deployment to identify and address any potential issues.
* **Version Control and Change Management**:The use of version control and change management processes aids in the tracking and management of changes made to packaged applications. It ensures proper documentation, promotes collaboration, and allows organizations to revert to previous versions if necessary.
* **Packaging Standards and Templates**: Setting packaging standards and using predefined templates can help to speed up the repackaging process. Standardized practices ensure consistency and efficiency while lowering the likelihood of errors or variations in the final packages.
* **Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing:** Collaborating and sharing knowledge among repackagers within the organization promotes best practices and fosters continuous improvement. Sharing knowledge, experiences, and troubleshooting methods can improve the repackaging process and ensure better results.
