**The extensive list of [DJ controllers](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) supported by our [Top DJ Software](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) has grown by two.** 

DEX 3.17.1 (and above) includes support for two additional DJ controllers; the [Numark Party Mix Live](https://www.numark.com/product/party-mix-live) and [Numark Party Mix II](https://www.numark.com/product/party-mix-ii). The map files are included with installation of the [latest DEX 3 update](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) which means the controllers are already plug-and-play.

Here’s a quick look at what each freshly supported DJ controller offers DEX 3 DJs.

The [Numark Party Mix Live](https://www.numark.com/product/party-mix-live) is packed with all the core features DJs need, whether you’re new to DJing or longtime pro. Built-in speakers fill the room with dynamic sound and integrated LED lights create a beat-synchronized light show. Four performance pads on each deck allow quick access to effects, cue points, loops or samples. Play, Cue and Sync buttons provide complete playback control and access to automatic tempo matching between tracks on each deck for perfectly aligned mixes. Large, touch-sensitive jog wheels allow you to pause, backspin and even scratch tracks as you work through your playlist. An outer jog-wheel functions as pitch-bend so you can nudge tracks into alignment for the perfect blend.

Based on the original Party Mix Controller, the [Numark Party Mix II](https://www.numark.com/product/party-mix-ii) DJ Controller is packed with all the DJ performance essentials and a built in ‘light show’. The essential DJ controller features include large touch-sensitive jog wheels for scratching, large Filter effect knobs on each deck, Sync, play/pause and Cue buttons, pitch sliders for tempo adjustments, performance pads with various modes, library controls for scrolling and loading tracks, 2-band EQ on each deck, and for output a 1/8″ headphone jack and 1/8″ main output jack. The light show is projected by three multi-colored LEDs with wide-coverage lenses for a room-filling, beat-synchronized light show. With five lighting modes to choose from, finding the right vibe for your party is a snap.

**Output Configuration for DEX 3: Go into options and under the “Audio Routing” tab apply this configuration:**

* From Select Audio Device, Select the Numark WASAPI Option (you can also use [asio4all](https://www.asio4all.org/) as an alternative – use the same directions below for channel configuration).
* Deck A through D: 1+2
* Headphones 3+4
* All other options can be set to none/no audio (including additional headphone/preview device).
* Do NOT put a tick in the box for external mixer mode.
* That will provide the proper audio routing for headphone pre-fade listening (cue)
