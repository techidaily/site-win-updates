That is why it is necessary to put safety measures everywhere. Installing primary antivirus programs and internet security suites can decrease the likelihood of infection.

These programs usually scan your whole system and even target specific files. However, they can be slow and burdensome to the system at times.

What if you just need to scan a file? Or check if a particular website is infected?

## Advantages of Online Virus Scanner

Using online virus scanners offer several benefits. First, most online virus scanners are free. Some may have limited functions, but they are still useful especially if you just want to scan a particular file. Additionally, online virus scanners are always updated. Developers can add updates and upgrades to their systems without having the users download it every time.

Moreover, unlike your standard security suites on your computer, online virus scanners can utilize multiple scanners on their servers. Most, if not all, will use services from other security programs which scans your files at the same time. Some viruses and malware are smart enough to fool or even halt the operation of the installed security suite. Online virus scanners can avoid this scenario and catch well-hidden threats.

Here are some of the best online virus scanners.

### Jotti’s Malware Scan

![Best Online Virus Scanner - Jyotti Malware Scan](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Jottis-Malware-Scan.png "Jotti's Malware Scan")

Jotti’s Malware Scan is a free service which scans suspicious files. Unlike ESET Online Scanner, you do not have to download any tool. It focuses on examining the data you upload to its web application. That means, Jotti’s Malware Scan cannot be used to scan your system. It accepts up to five files at the same time. However, take note that there is a 100MB file size limit for each file uploaded.

Jotti’s Malware Scan uses several antivirus and anti-malware services. Upon uploading, the application will use popular scanners such as Bitdefender, AVG, Avast, ESET, Trend Micro, and more. Additionally, the tool always uses the updated versions of the scanners mentioned. While it looks simplistic, it is a useful tool for scanning specific files, especially installers and executable files, before using it on your system.

### F-Secure Online Scanner

![F-Secure Online Scanner](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/F-Secure-Online-Scanner.png "F-Secure Online Scanner")

F-Secure Online Scanner is an online tool which gets rid of viruses and spyware on your PC. Much like ESET Online Scanner, it aims to clean your PC of any threats lurking in it. It is safe to use along with any security programs. F-Secure Online Scanner is free to use. Also, it only requires a small download which is less than 1MB. It does not install itself on your system, but it downloads the latest threat signature database from its servers.

F-Secure Online Scanner is perfect during those times when you suspect that a threat is hiding on your system. It is important to constantly observe your computer’s performance. If you see a significant slowing down of apps and function, it is best to run your primary security program.

Metadefender is a simple online tool which scans and analyzes files, hashes, and IP addresses. It is very reminiscent of Jotti’s Malware Scan and Virus Total.

## Final Thoughts

Online scanners are useful tools to ensure that your system is clean. Additionally, you can use them to examine files, URLs, and hashes. However, they cannot replace your primary security suite. These tools need a constant Internet connection. Moreover, most programs are for specific functions. That means, they are perfect as a secondary security layer and not as your lone protection.
