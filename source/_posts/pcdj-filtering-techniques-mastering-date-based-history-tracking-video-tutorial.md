## PCDJ Filtering Techniques: Mastering Date-Based History Tracking - Video Tutorial

[![Filter History By Date in DJ software](https://i1.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/filterhistorybydate-coverimage-1.jpg?resize=706%2C321&ssl=1)](https://i1.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/filterhistorybydate-coverimage-1.jpg?fit=706%2C360&ssl=1 "Filter History By Date In DEX 3")

**The ‘History List’ in DEX 3 and DEX 3 RE DJ applications log and showcase every track you’ve ever mixed. Played track history is extremely handy for many DJs.**

For example, if you wish to **reference your played track list from last years New Years Eve party** you can – and then create a permanent playlist/user list from it or simply send it to the side-list to reuse.

**Tracks are logged in the History List with date and time stamps**, so you can scroll/browse and locate tracks visually. However, if you mix a lot of tunes in our [DJ software](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) the History List can quickly become a massive data-set – where browsing to locate a specific date would be a cumbersome task. This is where ‘**Filter History By Date**‘ comes in handy.

The ‘**Filter History By Date**‘ option found in both DEX 3 and DEX 3 RE allows you to **filter the History List by selecting a specific date from a pop-up Calendar**. Simply click on the date and the History List will filter immediately, only **showcasing the songs you loaded and played on that day**. From there DJs can quickly **create a stored playlist from the filtered history results or send all tracks to the side-list** to use right then and there during a mix set.
