* Again a dialogue box will appear, where you’ll have to click the **“Refresh Firefox”** button**.**

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/6-3.png)

The steps above will help you to change your browser to its default stage. But still, it won’t delete your data completely; your password and add-ons will stay in your browser, within which specific threats may hide. Hence, the steps above can’t be an ultimate solution, at times.

## Keep your Browsing Experience Safe

In any case, it is essential to protect your PC from all kinds of malware attack. The only potentially practical solution for this is, installing a good anti-malware software. You might already have an antivirus enabled on your computer.

Antivirus programs aren’t capable of identifying many kinds of new and emerging malware. Therefore, an anti-malware is the only solution for getting over the malware and spyware correctly. On that note, it is highly recommended to use MalwareFox, an efficient anti-malware that significantly helps in removing the various types of malware from your system. It delivers better results when compared to the process of resetting the browser to default settings.

The MalwareFox scans your browser thoroughly to detect the presence any malware. If it detects any such malicious program, it will automatically remove it. It also includes a competent Real-time protection and Malware detection & removal features.

## Epilogue

Remember, even if you reset the browser to default settings, it will not erase specific factors, such as the bookmarks, password, etc. As mentioned, these undeleted files may contain the malware. Therefore, the highly recommended endeavor is to use MalwareFox to prevent you from malware attacks, while browsing.
