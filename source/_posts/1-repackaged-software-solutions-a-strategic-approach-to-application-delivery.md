## Advantages of Application Repackaging

Application repackaging is a strong way to distribute programs in an enterprise environment, with many advantages over alternative methods. Repackaging entails capturing an application's data, registry settings, and other components and structuring them into an MSI package format that can be readily installed on target systems. When working with legacy applications or apps that were not originally built for MSI packaging, the process of application repackaging comes in handy.

### Advantages of Application Repackaging in Enterprise Deployment

There are several advantages to using application repackaging as a method for deploying applications in an enterprise environment. These advantages include:

* Consistency
* Customization
* Scalability
* Standardization
* Efficiency

One of the primary advantages of application repackaging is **consistency**. IT experts can ensure that an application is installed consistently across all target systems by generating an MSI package for it. This decreases the possibility of problems and assures that the application works properly on all computers. When IT experts manually install software, the chance of human error increases, which can lead to inconsistency.

Another advantage of application repackaging is **customization**. IT professionals can change an application's installation package by repackaging it, such as setting the application to work in a specific environment, adding features or capabilities, or providing patches or updates. This level of customization is not possible when using off-the-shelf installation packages, which are often limited in terms of customization options.

Application repackaging also offers **scalability**. Repackaging an application allows IT professionals to deploy it on a big scale while maintaining control over the installation process and assuring the packages' dependability and efficiency. This makes it simple to deploy apps within an enterprise environment.

### Standardization and Efficiency in Application Repackaging

**Standardization** is another key advantage of application repackaging. IT professionals can use the MSI format to create standardized and industry-standard installation packages, ensuring that the packages can be deployed using a variety of tools and technologies, such as Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM), Group Policy, or third-party deployment tools such as Advanced Installer. This makes it simple to deploy apps utilizing a wide range of tools and technologies without worrying about compatibility issues.

**Efficiency** is also an advantage of application repackaging. Repackaging an application can be a more efficient technique of distributing apps since it allows IT professionals to rapidly and simply construct installation packages without requiring access to the original installation media. When deploying apps, this can save a significant amount of time and resources, especially in big enterprise organizations.

Ultimately, application repackaging is an effective way for delivering apps in an enterprise setting. IT pros can use application repackaging to ensure that applications are installed consistently and reliably across all target platforms, while also modifying the installation package to fit unique needs. 

Furthermore, application repackaging enables IT professionals to deploy applications on a large scale while maintaining control over the installation process and ensuring standardized and efficient packages. 

Application repackaging offers IT professionals the benefits of consistency, personalization, scalability, standardization, and efficiency, making it a popular way of application deployment.
