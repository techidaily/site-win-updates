## The Difference Between Application Packaging and Repackaging

Packing and repackaging are two key principles in application deployment and installation. While both of these processes are necessary for developing reliable and efficient installation packages, they take different approaches and different factors into account.

### Application Packaging

**Application packaging** refers to creating an installation package from scratch, including the application files, registry settings, and other components required for the application to execute properly. 

Typically, the application packaging process involves using a specialized tool like Advanced Installer to capture the required files and settings. These are then organized into a package format, such as MSI, and the installation procedure on the target system is specified.

Ensuring the package includes all necessary components, is compatible with the target system, and can be installed smoothly and without conflicts is of utmost importance during the packaging process.

### Application Repackaging

In contrast, **application repackaging** involves modifying an existing installation package to meet specific criteria. This method is commonly used when an existing package needs to be updated, modified, or customized to align with the requirements of a particular environment or system configuration.

Repackaging encompasses various actions such as modifying packages to delete or add components, changing registry settings, and applying patches or updates to existing packages. Creating packaging from scratch is often less complex than application repackaging, as it requires a deep understanding of the existing package, its components, and the tools and technologies involved in its production.

Repackaging involves several procedures and considerations. One of the initial tasks is to analyze the existing package, understanding its components and dependencies. To inspect and make alterations to the contents of the package, you may need to utilize specialized tools like the Advanced Installer tool. During this phase, it is crucial to identify any potential issues or conflicts that may arise when updating the package. These could include missing dependencies or incompatibility with the target system.

### Repackaging process

Once the existing package has been analyzed, IT professionals can begin the re-packaging process, which can be separated into two areas:

* Repackaging via transform files
* Repackaging via Snapshot method
