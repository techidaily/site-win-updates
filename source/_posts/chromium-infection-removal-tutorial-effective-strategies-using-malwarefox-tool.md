## What is Chromium?

Chromium is an open-source web browser project created by Google, and the browser build by compiling its codes is known as Chromium browser. Google started the Chromium project in 2008, and since then, it has become the base for many popular browsers. The two most popular browsers of the internet world – Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge are based on Chromium Engine. Other big chromium-based browsers are – Opera, Brave, and Vivaldi.

## What is Chromium Virus?

It is essential to know that Chromium is itself a legitimate web browser. However, because of its open-source nature, cybercriminals are regularly maliciously using Chromium as a medium to spread their ill-disposed codes to thousands of systems. Since Chromium is an open-source project, its source code is readily and freely available on the internet for everyone to use. Cyberattackers modify Chromium’s code to inject their malware and spread it through various means.

This maliciously modified version of Chromium that harms the user’s system in many ways is popularly known as Chromium Virus. It is a form of the [Potentially Unwanted Program (PUP)](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/).

## Signs that Chromium Virus is on your System

When the malicious Chromium browser enters your system, you will notice some unusual changes happening automatically that will indicate the virus’s presence. Here is the list of some indications that confirm the infiltration of the Chromium virus.

1. You will notice the Chromium browser on the desktop that got installed automatically.
2. The default web browser is changed to Chromium.
3. There is some illegitimate search engine set as the default.
4. You see a lot of advertisements while browsing the internet.
5. The system becomes slow and sluggish.
6. The other browser you are using is hijacked, and settings are modified to promote fake search engines and web pages.
