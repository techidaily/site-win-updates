## What is Tamper Protection?

It is a Windows 10 feature that protects the Windows security apps like [in-built antivirus – Windows Defender](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/). In reality, it prevents any type of unauthorized external amendments that you do not make through the settings window.

It was first introduced in the Windows 10 in May 2019 (1903) update. BY enabling it, you can prevent any security bypasses on Windows Defender and Windows security settings. To clarify, any changes in security features would not be possible even through Command Prompt, Windows Powershell, and Registry Editor. So sometimes, it can also create a problem if you want to make some genuine changes manually. Nonetheless, you can disable it anytime from the settings.
