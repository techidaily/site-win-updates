## Hide Facebook Ads using Options

There are two common steps to follow to help remove unwanted Ads from always popping up when you are using your Facebook account. Providing regular feedback to the site leads to the removal of irrelevant Ads whilst Ads that seem to conform to your interests stay. Thus, this does not lead to the full removal of Ads from your Facebook.

The process above is done as follows:

[![Newsfeed Ad options](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Newsfeed-Ad-options.jpg)](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Newsfeed-Ad-options.jpg)

1. When a sponsored Ad appears on your Facebook page, click on the 3 dots button placed on the upper right corner of the post you are viewing  
   1. Click on “Hide Ad” if you don’t want this kind of Ad to appear again  
   2. Alternatively, click on “Report Ad”, if the Ad is offensive to you in any way
2. If you click on Hide Ad”, you will be asked to provide a reason for doing so. You can simply indicate your reasons whether it’s irrelevant or misleading

## Block Facebook Ads Using Ad Blockers

As much as some Facebook users may be content with simply customizing their profiles to only see Ads that appeal to them, others may want to completely have them removed from their page. This is where the third-party Ad blockers come to play.

Top-quality and system-level Ad blockers can completely remove Ads from your Facebook platform. When adjusted to meet your preferences, they cannot only block out Facebook Ads, but the program can do the same for other sites and Apps.
