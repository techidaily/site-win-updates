## About Norton Ghost

Norton Ghost is one **disk imaging and cloning tool** that firstly developed in the 1990s. It can help you make backup images of the whole hard disk, selected partitions or only those files that mean the most to you. When something goes wrong, Norton Ghost can [restore your computer to previous functional status](https://tools.techidaily.com/ubackup/products/). Besides, it can also help you clone one hard drive to another hard drive.

In a word, if you want to make an image back for your computer or want to clone to the new hard drive, Norton Ghost is not a bad choice. However, now Norton Ghost is **no longer available for the Home user**. It was **discontinued by Symantec in 2013**. Indeed you can still download the latest version - Norton Ghost 15, but it only offers a 30-day free trial and then you need to pay for it.

## How to Use Norton Ghost 15 Step by Step

Here in this guide, you will get the detailed steps about how to use Symantec Ghost in Windows 11/10/8/7\. You can simply search ‚Äú**Norton Ghost 15 download**‚Äù via your browser to get the tool. As we have mentioned above, it only offers a 30-day free trial. If you prefer a free tool to help you backup, restore or clone your hard drive, you can refer to the [next part](https://tools.techidaily.com/ubackup/products/) to get the best free alternative to Norton Ghost.
