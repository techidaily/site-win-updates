## Deciphering Adware: Recognizing Dangerous Pop-Ups & Learning Secure Eradication Methods

Companies often have online ad campaigns to push their products and services to potential customers. You encounter as many as 1,700 banner ads per month. As such, catching your attention is a top priority of ads. Eventually, the adware was born.

## What is Adware

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ads.png)

Adware is short for “advertisement software.” Apparently, aims to catch your attention in any way it can. Pop-ups, banners, toolbars, and alerts are classic adware activities. More aggressive methods are recently found online as well. It exists both as an online entity and a desktop application.

The mobile version of adware is called madware. It functions similarly to adware. Additionally, it can even send you unlimited text and chat messages to entice you to buy products.

## What does Adware do on your Computer?

In itself, adware is not dangerous. It is merely irritating because of its intrusive methods. It can be an efficient way to market products when used efficiently and ethically.

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/pop-up.png)

However, adware eats up system resources just like any application. For example, infinite pop-ups require your browser to take up more memory. It eventually affects your browsing activity. Pop-ups may even use bandwidth and data.

Desktop adware slows down your system significantly. It uses up the limited processing power of your computer. Adware exhausts your computer memory making the OS sluggish and even freezing.

It also affects your data usage. Adware downloads photos and videos to create eye-catching ads. It could eventually use up valuable data on your Internet data plans. It happens especially when you are on mobile.

## Why is Adware Dangerous?

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/hacker-1.png)

Hackers use adware as an effective way to make you click or run malware. Seeing a good deal online, “winning” a lottery, or catching your attention with unique products takes advantage of your interest. Adware can be used together with spyware. It tracks your activities including keystrokes on your keyboard, and screenshots of your workspace, and even gather sensitive information.

Some adware may collect data from your browsing habits. It is then used to create targeted advertisements based on your interest. For example, ads may suddenly show bags or shoes if you’ve recently used your browser to search for those items.

## How do you get Adware?

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/laptop-4.png)

There are countless ways that you can get adware. Some legitimate freeware or shareware comes with adware during installation. It is typically a way of generating revenues. The developers are paid a certain amount when users click on the advertisements.

Sometimes, you install toolbars or extensions that come with adware. It inserts itself during your browsing. Adware may also become a part of an add-on’s interface.

Malicious websites can also install adware on your system. Hacker methods are typically employed. Trojans can be used to “inject” adware on your PC. Usually, it goes unnoticed more often than not.

## How to Prevent Adware?

Having a good, clean browsing habit protects you from adware. However, you cannot wholly escape adware. However, there are a few things you can do to avoid the annoying and potentially dangerous ones.

## How to Remove Adware?

Adware can get through your system even with the most reliable protection. It is because some adware is non-intrusive. Some security suite comes with adware. You may notice occasional pop-ups about your antivirus from time to time. These are not harmful.

You may have to uninstall the offending program if the ads annoy you. Sometimes it is not possible to block adware entirely on your computer.

Run a scan using your antivirus. It will analyze your system for any harmful adware. Drag and drop suspicious files or folders to perform a Deep Scan, which ensures that there is no infection.

## Final Thoughts

Adware is quite helpful when used correctly and ethically. Advertisements have been a part of modern life since the inception of marketing. However, it is essential to know that adware is also a gateway to your computer. Hackers use it to install more robust malicious programs. Ensure layered security and safe browsing and downloading habits.[](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/)
