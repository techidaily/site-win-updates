**Thesycon’s [DPC Latency Checker](http://www.thesycon.de/eng/latency%5Fcheck.shtml) is a Windows-Only utility that analyses the capabilities of your DJ computer system to handle real-time data streams, and it’s FREE.**

When trying to figure out if your Windows computer is up to snuff for sufficiently running [DJ software](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) like PCDJ DEX or RED Mobile trouble-free, The DPC latency checker will look  
to see if there would be any potential cause for interruptions in real-time audio and video streams, also known as drop-outs. We’ve found the latency checker to be a very useful [![dpc latency checker](https://i1.wp.com/www.pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/dpc-latency-checker-300x254.jpg?resize=300%2C254&ssl=1)](https://pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/dpc-latency-checker.jpg)tool for our PCDJ customers if they have any concerns about their Windows 7 computer not being capable of stable problem-free live DJing. 

When the DPC Latency Checker scans your machine, what you’re hoping for is the following message (if you receive this, you should have no issues running [DJ Mixing Software](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) if the machine also meets PCDJ’s posted minimum system requirements:

> _**This machine should be able to handle real-time streaming of audio and/or video without drop-outs.**_ 

You’re also looking to make sure the performance measurement bars remain in the Green/Yellow graph area, never in the red. red = bad, and potential for drop outs. If you’re system is barely in the red, you should check background services and other software (such as antivirus) running in the background and shut down all that you can. [Check out this previous blog article for general DJ computer system optimization for DJ software](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/)

**Currently, the tool isn’t working 100% on Windows 8 or 8.1, here’s why:**

> _Windows 8 Compatibility: The DPC latency utility runs on Windows 8 but does not show correct values. The output suggests that the Windows 8 kernel performs badly and introduces a constant latency of one millisecond, which is not the case in practice. DPCs in the Windows 8 kernel behave identical to Windows 7\. The utility produces incorrect results because the implementation of kernel timers has changed in Windows 8, which causes a side effect with the measuring algorithm used by the utility. Thesycon is working on a new version of the DPC latency utility and will make it available on this site as soon as it is finished._

  
So, keep checking back if you’re running windows 8\. Since Windows 8 is notorious for running many “extra’s” in the background, I’m sure it will prove even more useful to those individuals once Thesycon has updated it.
