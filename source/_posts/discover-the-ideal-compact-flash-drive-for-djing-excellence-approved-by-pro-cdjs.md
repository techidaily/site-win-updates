## Discover the Ideal Compact Flash Drive for DJing Excellence, Approved by Pro CDJs

_“The anodized, aircraft-grade aluminum housing is waterproof to 200 meters, vibration-resistant, and shock-resistant.” – [Corsair.com](http://www.corsair.com/en-us/flash-survivor-stealth-usb-3-0-32gb-usb-flash-drive)_

Ooooh, sounds impressive doesn’t it?

If you’re a DJ working in a venue where there’s a fixed computer installation you’re likely already using a [USB flash drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB%5Fflash%5Fdrive) to transport your music. They are convenient, fit on your key-chain and the technology has improved greatly over the years making them a more reliable and viable option to play directly from (_as is the case with various DJ controllers that have flash drive playback_).

With that said a truly robust and road-warrior worthy USB drive for DJs that can withstand a regular pounding (_and a few spilling cocktails_) has’t really emerged, until now.

### Corsair Flash Survivor Stealth USB Drive

Enter the **[Corsair Flash Survivor Stealth USB](http://www.corsair.com/en-us/flash-survivor-stealth-usb-3-0-32gb-usb-flash-drive)** 3.0 (_with backwards compatibility for USB 2.0_) Drive, which comes in 16, 32, 64, 128 and 256GB versions.

This **rugged USB drive** can survive total submersion in a jack-and-coke. If you forget and leave it in your car during a scorcher, no worries, it can handle extreme temps of around 300 degrees (_[This YouTube video is confirmation](https://youtu.be/aAXCckQPeKo)_).

A DJs music is the lifeblood, therefore if you’re a jock that utilizes flash drives for laptop DJing or a DJ controller with direct USB flash drive support the Survivor Stealth USB Drive should be at the top of your wishlist. It doesn’t hurt that it looks really cool, too.
