## Secure Your Browser: Expert Strategies to Prevent Viruses Through Chrome Notifications

Chrome’s Push Notification is a useful tool for many users, as it notifies them of the new happenings on their favorite websites. Most users enable push notifications for social media websites such as [Facebook](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/), Twitter, or Instagram to get a quick glance at them instead of opening the site. These notifications pop up from the bottom-right corner of the screen.

## What are these Notifications?

As already mentioned in the intro, the push notifications from the Chrome web browser are the information sent by the websites, which have got permission from the users. These notifications are displayed outside the browser window and will also pop up even if the site is inactive, and the browser is closed. This is what makes it apart from the pop-up notifications, which only appear when the browser is active.

## How did I Get Them?

Unless your browser got hacked, these notifications would only appear if you have allowed the site to send you those. You might have noticed some websites, particularly social media sites and blogs, ask permission to allow the notifications when you visit them for the first time. The website takes your consent through a pop-up that appears at the top and looks like this.

![Push Notifications](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Push-Notifications.jpg)

Suppose you are receiving irrelevant notifications from the websites that you do not remember allowing. In that case, it is because you might have visited an infected website and unintentionally allowed it to send the push notifications.

Many websites trick users into making them click on the allow button, and it traps most users without them knowing the intention. For example, this website asks the user to click on “Allow” to watch the video.

![allow to watch video](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/allow.png)

It is possible that your browser may be hijacked, and it might allow irrelevant websites to send the notifications without your permission.

## Are they Useful?

Push Notifications are highly useful when you want to take a quick glimpse of your social media happenings. For example, if someone has liked your status or picture on your[Facebook profile](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/), the push notification will display this information in the pop-up, and you won’t have to take the trouble of opening the website.

Likewise, if you have allowed your favorite blog site to show you a notification, you would be notified every time a new article is posted.

So, these notifications don’t need to be always annoying.

## How can Chrome Notifications be used for Virus attacks?

Cybercriminals always try to find different ways to infect your computer with [malware](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/). Developers exploit every new feature to use it maliciously. The same happens with push notifications. Cybercriminals can use it like they use pop-up notifications.

Marketers can unethically utilize it for increasing website clicks to generate revenue. 

Notifications bear no threat by themselves. So, cyberattackers would force you to click on it by giving intriguing titles to the notifications, just like this.
