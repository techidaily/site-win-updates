[LEARN MORE ABOUT DEX 3 ![](https://i1.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/DEX3-videos.jpg?resize=180%2C180&ssl=1 "DEX3-videos")](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/)

Our two **[mixing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/)** platforms for pro DJs are [DEX 3](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) (_audio/video/karaoke_) and [RED Mobile 3](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) (_audio/basic karaoke_). Both are designed to fill different live performance requirements of professional DJs and mobile entertainers. 

With 4-deck support and video mixing capabilities, DEX 3 is designed for performance artists – for DJs that want to not only offer the total multimedia mixing experience, but want to get creative in the mix by layering in tracks, samples and effects (both audio, and video). It’s our flagship **_MIX EVERYTHING_** solution.

[LEARN MORE ABOUT RED MOBILE 3 ![](https://i1.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/redmob3-square.jpg?resize=180%2C180&ssl=1 "redmob3-square")](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/)

RED Mobile 3 is simple to navigate, yet robust. Just like DEX 3 the browser will handle a million audio or karaoke files with ease. You have all the basic transport mixing controls and automix capabilities a mobile DJ needs, and a few effects to liven up the mix.

We put together this **DJ software comparison chart** to better explain all the differences between our two professional solutions. We hope the chart helps DJs considering one of our products to better figure out what product works best for their specific needs.
