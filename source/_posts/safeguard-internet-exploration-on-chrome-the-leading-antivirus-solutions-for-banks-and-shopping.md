The HTTPS Everywhere Chrome extension would convert the HTTP websites into HTTPS so that if you require to browse any HTTP site, you can do it without any security risk. After adding the HTTPS Everywhere and enabling it in Chrome Browser, the next time when you visit any unsecured HTTP site, it would be automatically converted to HTTPS.
