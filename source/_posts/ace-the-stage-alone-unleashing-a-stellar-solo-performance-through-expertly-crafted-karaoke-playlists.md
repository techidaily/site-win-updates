## Ace the Stage Alone: Unleashing a Stellar Solo Performance Through Expertly Crafted Karaoke Playlists

[![Solo Artist Performer Backing Tracks Cover](https://i0.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/soloartist-coverimage.jpg?resize=706%2C321&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/soloartist-coverimage.jpg?fit=706%2C360&ssl=1 "Solo Artist Performer Backing Tracks Cover")

**Last week Digitrax Entertainment announced the addition of 7,500+ karaoke backing tracks added to Karaoke Cloud Pro, the in-Karaoki subscription service that already provides 6000 karaoke tracks (with on-screen lyrics).**

The 7,500 plus **karaoke backing tracks** are high-quality re-creations, just like the standard karaoke content already included, **minus on-screen lyrics**. Without the inclusion of on-screen lyrics **there is no need for a synchronization license**, therefore many of the artists on the [Karaoke No-Fly list](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) can be included. **Artists such as Adele, Katy Perry and Bon Jovi** – to name a few.

Other **backing tracks** included are waiting for approval from the publishers so on-screen lyrics can be added and re-released into Karaoke Cloud Pro, but the thought was until they are cleared it would be better to include them without lyrics for the time being. We agree, since **Karaoki is popular with Solo Artists** that simply need backing tracks to play and/or sing along with.

**Karaoki includes a “Solo Artist” rotation mode**, designed specifically for performers that aren’t hosting karaoke. In Solo Artist Mode the rotation list in Karaoki works more like a standard queue list. The performer can use the “Load Next Singer” button to load and play from the list manually (You can also **map the ‘Load Next Singer’ button in Karaoki to a USB foot pedal/switch**, which some Solo Artist prefer for hands-free operation), or setup for auto-karaoke and select the amount of silence between tracks.

With [Karaoke Cloud Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) now offering a massive selection of **karaoke backing tracks** Solo Artists may have a greater incentive to [subscribe to the $99-a-month karaoke subscription service](https://www.karaokelocker.com/subscription.pl), offering them the library they need to perform for any crowd. With iTunes selling karaoke **backing tracks** at $2-a-pop it’s also **cost-effective for Solo Artists** performing at least a handful of times monthly.

[Karaoki](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) (In Solo Artist Mode) + [Karaoke Cloud Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) (backing tracks) together create an **ideal duet for Solo Artist performers**.
